# TypeScript - Functions

This is exercise from Module 3 Guide "Functions".

##  What I Learned
- Creating and exporting functions in TypeScript
- Using `localStorage` 
- Sending HTTP requests 
- Handling errors and success responses
- Testing and interpreting browser output

##  Browser Output
After launching `index.html` on a local server (`127.0.0.1:5500`), I saw the following messages:

-  `Error: "Duplicate was found"`
-  `Success: "Maria was removed"`
-  `Success: "John was updated"`
-  `Success: "Name: John, Email: john@gmail.com, Phone number: Not provided, Company: Not provided"`
-  `Alex <alex@gmail.com>, John <john@gmail.com>`
-  `The contact list was cleared`

These messages confirm that the functions are working correctly: removing, updating, checking for duplicates, and displaying contact information are all functioning as expected.
